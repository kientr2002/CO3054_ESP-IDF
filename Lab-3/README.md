# Embedded System Lab 03: FreeRTOS Tasks Scheduling
* Description:
  Design and implement examples for each scheduling mentioned above, they are:
  • Prioritized Pre-emptive Scheduling with Time Slicing
  • Prioritized Pre-emptive Scheduling (without Time Slicing)
  • Co-operative Scheduling
* Preparation:
   * IDE and Extensions (We use VSCode and Espressif IDF, You can reference from [here](https://github.com/kientr2002/CO3054_ESP-IDF)
   * Mtiny ESP32 WROOM-32E (Arduino Compatible) (You also use another version of ESP32, this device that you can buy [here](https://hshop.vn/products/mach-mtiny-esp32-wroom-32e-arduino-compatible)) <br>
